# TextProcessing
Applying some basic Natural Language Processing techniques e.g.: Parts of speech tagging ,  Named entity Recognizer and Stemming

* We have organized the project as below,
  * src/
    * classifiers/
    * text-mining/
    * taggers/
  
This project was setup to perform, first, the parts-of-speech tagging using the Standford NLP parser. 
For example, the entity Singapore is annotated as type "Location"
